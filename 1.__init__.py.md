#### what is `__init__.py` File:
> [!tip] You have a directory with a bunch of Python files and you want to treat it as a package. Just drop an `__init__.py` file inside!!!
> Python recognizes that directory as a package 

#### what is inside `__init__.py` file:
>The `__init__.py` file can be as simple as an empty file, or you can include some initialization code if you have special setup needs.
>But most of the time, an empty `__init__.py` is JUST FINE

Without `__init__.py` file Python wouldn't see your directory as a package and wouldn't be able to import modules from it using standart "import" statement:
`from my_file import ...` - not works
