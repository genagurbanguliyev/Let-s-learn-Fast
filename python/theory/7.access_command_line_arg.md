```python
import sys

print(sys.argv)
```

More specifically, if you run `python example.py one two three`:

```python
>>> import sys
>>> print(sys.argv)
['example.py', 'one', 'two', 'three']
```

***
(not including the name of the Python file)

```python
import sys

sys.argv[1:]
```

The `[1:]` is a [slice](https://stackoverflow.com/a/509295/208273) starting from the second element (index 1) and going to the end of the arguments list. This is because the first element is the name of the Python file, and we want to remove that.
