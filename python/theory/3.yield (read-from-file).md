**without yield:**
```python
def fetch_lines(filename):
	with open(filename, 'r') as file:
		lines = []
		for line in lines:
			lines.append(line)
		return lines

zen = feth_lines('./assets/for_yield.txt')
print(zen)
```

result will be:
```

[
	'line one is the first line of file\n',
	'line two second line\n',
	'line three\n',
	'line four\n',
	'...'
]
```

***
**With yield**
```python
def fetch_lines(filename):
	with open(filename, 'r') as file:
		lines = []
		for line in lines:
			yield line

zen = feth_lines('./assets/for_yield.txt')

print(next(zen)) # prints only first line

print(next(zen)) # prints the second line

print(next(zen))
```

result will be:
```
line one is the first line of file

line two second line

line three
```
