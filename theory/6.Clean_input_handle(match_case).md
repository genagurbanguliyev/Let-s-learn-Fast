> [! ] we have two functions `do_this()` and `do_that()`, users would like to run one of them we can use Python's `match: case` statement: 

```python
def do_this():
	print("Do This")

def do_that():
	print("Do That")

match input("Do this or that?"):
	case "this":
		do_this()
	case "that":
		do_that()
	case _:
		print("Invalid input")
```
