### Error saving credentials
when you try login to your docker account.. if there error like below:
```
Error saving credentials: error storing credentials - err: exit status 1, out: `error getting credentials - err: exit status 1, out: `no usernames for https://index.docker.io/v1/``
```


**1. Check Docker Permissions:**

- Ensure your user has write permissions to the Docker configuration directory:
    - **Linux/macOS:** Run `ls -ld ~/.docker` and verify your user has write permissions (indicated by "w" in the permissions column).
    - **Windows:** Right-click on the `.docker` directory in your user's home directory and check the "Write" permission for your user account.

**2. Remove Existing Configuration (Optional):**

- If the permissions seem correct, you can try removing the existing Docker configuration to force a clean setup:
    - **Linux/macOS:** Run `sudo rm -rf ~/.docker` (**caution:** this deletes your existing Docker configuration, including stored credentials).
    - **Windows:** Delete the `.docker` directory in your user's home directory (**caution:** this deletes your existing Docker configuration, including stored credentials).

**3. Address Credential Helper Issues:**

- If you're using a Docker credential helper (like `docker-credential-helper-osxkeychain` on Mac), there might be an issue with its configuration.
    - Check the documentation for your specific credential helper and ensure it's properly installed and configured.
    - Consider temporarily disabling the credential helper by setting `DOCKER_CONFIG=~/.docker` (without the credential helper) and try logging in again.
