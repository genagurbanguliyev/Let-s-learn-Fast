#### Meaning:
> A specific block of code runs only when the Python script is executed directly. Not when 
> it's imported as a module.
>`__name__` represents current module's name.
> if your run script `__name__` = `__main__` inside that script, and if you import the script 
> inside another script `__name__` = `script_name`(module name)

***

Example:
> your have `script1.py` and `script2.py` files

`script1.py`:
```python
def do_something():
	print("Run own logics")
 
do_something()
```

`script2.py`:
```python
from script1 import do_something

do_something()
```

if run run `script2.py` file,  result will be as:
```sh
Run own logics
Run own logics
```


`do_something()` - runs twice, that's because it's running it in import first (inside `script2`)
from `script1` because its run everything inside `script1` and `script1` has call for `do_something()`

solve this, let's do `script1.py` like as below:
```python
def do_something():
	print("Run own logics")

if __name__ == __main__:
	do_something()
```

after that if we run `script2.py` result will be:
```sh
Run own logics
```
