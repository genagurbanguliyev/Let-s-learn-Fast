lambda functions can only have single line expressions, `regular functions` we were have to add `return` keyword, but `lambda functions` we don't have to do that
```python
# regular functions:
def add(x,y):
	return x+y
print(add(4,5))

# lambda f:
lambda x,y: x+y

# you could assign this to a variable lambda functions
add = lambda x,y: x+y
```

lambda functions also known as "anonymous functions".
if you want assign functions to a variable, advice use `regular functions`

`lambda functions` can run when they assinged:
```python
print((lambda x,y: x+y)(4,5))
```

### Point of `lambda functions`
they're made to be passed into a higher-order functions
> [!tldr] Higher-order functions - it is a function that can either take in another function as input or return a function or both `for-example:` 
> functions can take list as input and also take in a function as an input
```python
def my_map(my_func, my_iter):
	return [my_func(new_item) for new_item in my_iter]

nums = [2,3,4,5]
cubes = my_map(lambda x: x**3, nums)

print(cubes)
```
