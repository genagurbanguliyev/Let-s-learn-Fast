### 1. **Linux Kernel's Swap Tendency (Swappiness Setting)**:

Linux has a parameter called **`swappiness`**, which determines how aggressively the kernel moves memory pages from RAM to swap. Even if there's available RAM, the kernel might decide to move less frequently used pages to swap to keep more free RAM for active tasks or for disk caching purposes.

- A **higher `swappiness` value** (default is 60 in most systems) means the system will swap more aggressively, even when there's available RAM.
- A **lower `swappiness` value** means the system will prefer to keep data in RAM and swap less.

You can check your current swappiness value by running:
`cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness`

You can adjust it temporarily with:
```bash
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10  # Adjust to a lower value like 10
```

To make this change permanent, you need to modify `/etc/sysctl.conf` and add:
`vm.swappiness=10`

### 2. **Long-Running or Idle Processes**:

Sometimes, background processes or infrequently accessed memory pages are moved to swap to keep active memory pages in RAM. The kernel tries to optimize by keeping frequently accessed pages in RAM and moves idle pages to swap.

### 3. **Disk Caching**:

Linux aggressively caches disk data in RAM. Your system may have a significant portion of RAM used for disk caching, which might explain why your RAM is not fully used for active processes. You can check how much is being used for cache by running:
```bash
free -h
```

This command will show you how much of your RAM is being used by buffers and cache.

### Solutions:

- **Reduce Swappiness**: Try lowering the swappiness as mentioned above.
- **Monitor Processes**: Check if there are any long-running or idle processes that are using a large amount of memory and being moved to swap.
- **Clear Cache** (if necessary): If caching is too aggressive, you can clear it temporarily (not generally recommended unless absolutely needed): 
```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3
```
