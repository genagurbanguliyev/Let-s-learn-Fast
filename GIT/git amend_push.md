### Steps to Push After `git commit --amend`:

1. **Force push your changes to the remote branch:**    
    `git push --force`
    
    Or if you're working with a specific branch:
    `git push --force origin your-branch-name`
    
    > **Note:** Be cautious with force-pushing, as it rewrites the commit history on the remote branch and can affect other collaborators if they have already pulled the previous version of the branch.
    
2. **If others are working on the branch:** If other collaborators are working on the same branch, force-pushing can cause conflicts. In this case, it’s best to communicate with your team to avoid disruptions.
    

### Alternative: `git push --force-with-lease`

A safer alternative to force-pushing is using `--force-with-lease`, which ensures that your force push will only happen if no one else has pushed changes to the remote branch after you pulled it. If someone else has made changes, it will stop and let you know.
`git push --force-with-lease`

This option is useful when working in teams to avoid accidentally overwriting someone else’s changes.

### Summary:

- Use `git push --force` to push after `git commit --amend`.
- If you're working with others, consider using `git push --force-with-lease` for added safety.
